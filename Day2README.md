1.Nine Pillars Understanding
1(a) Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
     better for your growth as a system architect?

  AI Development agents help with repeating setup, overcome the mistakes of developers, and faster and quickly build better model behaviors,   strongly and productively improving problem-solving skills. System architects guide systems, not just build them piece by piece. Using AI    tools makes your workflow more strategic, not mechanical. That is why a developer can grow in the creation, analytical, high-value parts     of system architecture.

1(b) Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
     Developer?
  M-Shaped Developer strategies build strong and deeper skills in many different areas, not just coding; they teach technical,                 architectural, and AI-collaborative expertise. By learning these pillars, a developer becomes good at several specialties and also           understands how everything connects in a full system.
  
2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
2(a) Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe coding does not have a strong building base of requirements, strategies, or structure. It is just a feeling that picks the idea and makes on-the-spot decisions without any prerequisites of the project. So vibe coding creates problems after one week without any specification, the code becomes difficult and hard to understand for humans.
