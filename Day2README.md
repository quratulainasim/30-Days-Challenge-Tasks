TASK-1

1.Nine Pillars Understanding

1(a) Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
     better for your growth as a system architect?

  AI Development agents help with repeating setup, overcome the mistakes of developers, and faster and quickly build better model behaviors,strongly and productively improving problem-solving skills. System architects guide systems, not just build them piece by piece. Using AI tools makes your workflow more strategic, not mechanical. That is why a developer can grow in the creation, analytical, high-value parts of system architecture.

1(b) Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?
   
 M-Shaped Developer strategies build strong and deeper skills in many different areas, not just coding; they teach technical,               architectural, and AI-collaborative expertise. By learning these pillars, a developer becomes good at several specialties and also         understands how everything connects in a full system.
  
2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
   
2(a) Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe coding does not have a strong building base of requirements, strategies, or structure. It is just a feeling that picks the idea and makes on-the-spot decisions without any prerequisites of the project. So vibe coding creates problems after one week without any specification, the code becomes difficult and hard to understand for humans.

2(b) How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

Specification-Driven Development avoids the problems of vibe coding because SDD defines all the prerequisites of the project, its structure, and specifications. This allows developers to achieve easier debugging, less rework, better teamwork, and consistent decision making throughout the development process.

3.  Architecture Thinking

3(a) How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

In an architecture-focused system, developers become strategic partners. This approach shifts their role from just coding to planning, designing, and guiding the system. Developers turn into architects who collaborate with AI to solve problems, make better decisions, and avoid rework and errors.

3(b) Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code?

Developers should think in layers and systems, not just raw code. This way, the project stays organized, problems are easier to find and fix, and the system can grow or change smoothly. It also makes teamwork easier and lets AI tools work better. Overall, it helps build software that’s clear, reliable, and scalable.
