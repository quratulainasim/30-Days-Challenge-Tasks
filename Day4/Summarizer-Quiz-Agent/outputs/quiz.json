      "question": "Explain what an 'Agent' abstraction is within the OpenAI Swarm framework, including its key characteristics.",
      "answer": "An Agent is an encapsulated unit where instructions, a model, and tools are defined. It is an intelligent component dependent on a large language model (LLM), executing tasks through its own instructions (system prompts) and tools (python functions). Each agent performs its work separately and is specialized in a particular role, such as an 'English Agent' or 'Spanish Agent'."

      "type": "short_answer",
      "question": "Describe the 'Routing' design pattern with an example, as explained in the text.",
      "answer": "The 'Routing' design pattern involves sending a task to the most suitable agent based on its specialization. As an example, in a customer service chatbot, a 'Router agent' first analyzes the user's message. If the user expresses a 'billing issue', it sends the query to a 'Billing Agent'. If it's a 'technical error', it forwards to a 'Tech Support Agent'. This ensures that each query is handled by an agent expert in that specific domain."
