## What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is a helpful toolkit that helps you build software using AI. Instead of just asking the AI to build an app all at once, SPECKit Plus breaks the process down into organized steps. This makes sure the AI understands exactly what you want, follows the rules, and builds high-quality code. It turns a messy process into a clear, step-by-step workflow.

## 1. Constitution (/constitution)

Think of this as the "Rulebook" for the AI. Before starting any work, you tell the AI things like "Always use clear variable names,Keep the design simple,or Make sure the app works on mobile phones. The AI will check this rulebook every time it does something to make sure it's not breaking any laws of your project.

## 2. Specify (/specify)

This is the "Idea" phase. You tell the AI, I want a to-do list app where users can add tasks and cross them off.You explain the problem you are solving and who it is for. The AI takes your idea and writes a detailed description (Specification) of what the final product should look like and do.

## 3. Plan (/plan)

This is the "Blueprint" phase. Now that the AI knows what to build, it makes a plan for how to build it. It decides which coding languages to use (like Python or JavaScript), what files to create, and the order in which to build things. It's like an architect drawing the blueprints before the builders start working.

## 4. Tasks (/tasks)
This is the "To-Do List" for the AI. Instead of trying to build the whole house at once, the AI makes a list: Step 1: Pour the foundation,Step 2: Build the walls,Step 3: Put on the roof.This makes the work easier to manage and allows you to check the AI's work after each small step.

## 5. Implement (/implement)

This is the "Building" phase. The AI rolls up its sleeves and starts writing the code. It follows the Plan, checks the Constitution for rules, and completes the Tasks one by one. You can watch it build your app piece by piece, reviewing the code as it goes.
