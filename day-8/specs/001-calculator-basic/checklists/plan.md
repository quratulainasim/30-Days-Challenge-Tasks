**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task generation
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](specs/001-calculator-basic/plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details outside of the technical context
- [x] Clearly links to the feature specification

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Plan Completeness

- [x] Technical context fully defined (language, dependencies, testing, platform, performance, constraints, scale)
- [x] Project structure (source code and documentation) is clearly outlined
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Risks and mitigation strategies are identified (if applicable)
- [x] Key decisions and rationale are documented

## Readiness for Tasks

- [x] Plan is detailed enough to create actionable, independent tasks
